Simple tool to enter youtube chats from the terminal


Go to the directory that you cloned this in 



python3 run.py 

________________________________________________________________


I will be adding a way to enter without the auth screen 


To pull up a streamers live chat you have to do /streamer + streamername


To exit out of streamers chat do ctrl + c


To clear all text do /clear


To quit the program do /quit


The login in command does not work as of now but will be up within the next week


I will add a way to reply in chat witin the next week
